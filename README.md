# TypeScript and Angular
## Setup and initialisation
1. `install node`  
2. use `npm init`  
3. use `npm i typescript`  
4. use `tsc --init` to configure TypeScript with JavaScript  
## Converting from typescript to JavaScript
  Just run `tsc`
## What is an SPA?
  An SPA is a single page application where all webpages required for rendering a web-app are sent over in one shot and routing is done by the browser not an external server.
## How does Angular handle routing?
  Angular has routing functionality to handle routing. It also has a server-side routing (SSR) option which has SPA functionality (but not complete re-routing). SSR is better for SEO.
